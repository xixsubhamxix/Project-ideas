Project Ideas
A personal list of technical projects I want to build to improve my skills in computer engineering, GPU programming, game systems, and AI.

-Hardware / GPU Projects
 Build an OpenGL renderer from scratch

 Write a GPU benchmarking tool

 Create a visualizer that monitors GPU load in real time

-Game Systems and Computer Engineering
 Build a simple emulator (e.g., GameBoy or NES)

 Research and implement a basic anti-cheat technique

 Write a custom graphics shader using GLSL

-AI and Hardware Integration
 Run a neural network on a Raspberry Pi

 Explore tinygrad or llama.cpp and break down how they work

 Combine OpenGL rendering with basic computer vision logic
