# ðŸš€ Project Ideas

A personal list of projects I want to build to improve my skills in computer engineering, GPU programming, game systems, and AI.

## ðŸ”§ Hardware / GPU Projects
- [ ] Build an OpenGL renderer from scratch
- [ ] Write a GPU benchmarking tool
- [ ] Create a visualizer that uses GPU load in real-time

## ðŸŽ® Game Systems / CE-Focused
- [ ] Make a simple emulator (GameBoy or NES)
- [ ] Learn and implement a basic anti-cheat technique
- [ ] Write a custom graphics shader in GLSL

## ðŸ§  AI + Hardware Blends
- [ ] Run a neural network on a Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Try tinygrad or llama.cpp and understand how they work
- [ ] Combine OpenGL rendering with basic computer vision

## âœ… Completed Projects
- [ ] (Nothing yet â€” starting soon!)
